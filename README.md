MedSupply Guardian is an easy-to-use Android app that helps you manage all your medical supplies in one place.

You can add, edit, and delete items, track quantities, and monitor expiry dates.

The app sends low-stock and expiry reminders so you never miss important updates.

It uses a Room database for offline storage and Firebase authentication for Google and email/password login.

The UI is built with Jetpack Compose and follows Material 3 design with dynamic light/dark themes.

The project follows MVVM + Clean Architecture, separating data, domain, and presentation layers.

The app provides a simple, modern, and organized way to keep track of essential medical supplies.
